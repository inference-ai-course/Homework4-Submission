      "Most consumer screens are described by their diagonal measurement (in inches or cm), but there are a few other useful ways to express size. Here’s how to measure and what to do if the screen isn’t a simple rectangle.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Rectangular screens (TVs, monitors, most phones)\n",
      "- Measure the visible active width (W) and height (H) of the display (do not include the bezel).\n",
      "- The common “screen size” is the diagonal: diagonal = sqrt(W^2 + H^2). Example: a 16\" × 9\" rectangle has diagonal sqrt(16^2 + 9^2) = 18.36\", so a consumer 19\" (approx) monitor might be described by its diagonal.\n",
      "- Also useful: aspect ratio = W:H (e.g., 16:9), and resolution (pixels) or pixel density (PPI = pixels per inch = horizontal pixels / W_in_inches).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Screens with rounded corners or small cutouts\n",
      "- Manufacturers usually quote the diagonal of the full rectangular area that would enclose the active display (or the visible active area corner-to-corner). If you’re measuring yourself, use the maximum visible width and height and compute the diagonal as above.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Curved screens\n",
      "- Reported the same way: diagonal of the active display area (not the arc length along the curve). Measure straight-line corner-to-corner across the active area.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Circular screens\n",
      "- Use diameter (the straight-line distance across the circle). You can also give area = π·(d/2)^2.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Irregularly shaped screens (e.g., arbitrary shapes, very unusual wearables)\n",
      "- Options depending on what you need:\n",
      "  - Bounding rectangle/diagonal: measure the maximum width and height and use diagonal = sqrt(W^2 + H^2). This is how many manufacturers standardize sizes.\n",
      "  - Area: measure the active area (in square inches or cm). For complex shapes this can be done from a template, by tracing and measuring, or from pixel count if you know resolution and which pixels are active.\n",
      "  - Equivalent diameter: for something roughly circular-ish, give the diameter of a circle with the same area: d_eq = 2·sqrt(area/π).\n",
      "  - Report pixels/active pixel count instead — for many applications pixel resolution is more informative than physical shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick practical steps\n",
      "- Use a ruler or tape measure to get W and H in inches or cm.\n",
      "- Compute diagonal if you want the common “screen size”: diagonal = sqrt(W^2 + H^2).\n",
      "- If corners are rounded, measure the maximum visible W and H (ignore bezel) and use those.\n",
      "- If shape is odd and you care about usable area, measure or calculate active area and report that.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you tell me the shape and what you care about (diagonal, usable viewing area, or pixel size), I can give a specific method or help compute it.\n"
