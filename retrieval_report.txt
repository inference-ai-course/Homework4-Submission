We then introduce noisy labels, by flipping labels of 1% of class 2 train samples to any another random class label, and train the model till it achieves 100% train accuracy. NICO++ dataset [Zhang et al., 2023] consists of approximately 60,000 images distributed across 60 categories of everyday objects. In this study, we select a subset of 15 object categories, including car, flower, penguin, came...

(a). We further evaluate the re- trieval accuracy using attention weights as retrieval scores to identify evidence pages, as shown in Figure 2 (b). In ad- dition, we compute query-to-visual similarity using hidden states from each layer as embeddings, enabling embedding- based retrieval, as shown in Figure 2 (c). From the visual- izations and metrics, we observe the following trends: (1) In the ea...

Paper ID: 2511.10229v1
Chunk Index: 1
Distance Score: 0.8502

Text Excerpt (first 400 characters):
Despite these advances, the success of multilingual instruction tuning remains highly sensitive to the composi- tion and selection of the training data. Consequently, Data Selection has emerged as a critical strategy for balancing ef- fectiveness and efficiency in large-scale model training. Ex- isting approaches can be typically grouped into two main categories: feature-based methods, which prior...
