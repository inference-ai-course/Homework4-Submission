* Data & Index: See src/chunks.json & 
* Retrieval Report: See retrieval_report.json
* FastAPI Service: The FastAPI app code (e.g. main.py) and instructions on how to run it. The /search endpoint should be demonstrable (e.g. returning top-3 passages in JSON for sample queries).

# Running FastApi code
This model was trained on data about electrons. Queries should be related to electrons.

Go to src and run uvicorn
```bash
cd src
uvicorn main:app
