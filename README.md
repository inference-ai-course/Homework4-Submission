## Deliverables

* **Code Notebook / Script:** Complete code for the RAG pipeline (PDF extraction, chunking, embedding, indexing, retrieval).
* **Data & Index:** The FAISS index file and the set of 50 processed paper chunks (e.g., as JSON or pickled objects).
* **Retrieval Report:** A brief report showing at least 5 example queries and the top-3 retrieved passages for each, to demonstrate system performance.
* **FastAPI Service:** The FastAPI app code (e.g. `main.py`) and instructions on how to run it. The `/search` endpoint should be demonstrable (e.g. returning top-3 passages in JSON for sample queries).
